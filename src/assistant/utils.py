"""Utility functions for the assistant.

This module provides utility functions that are used across different parts of the application.
Functions for search and source formatting have been moved to common/search_tools.py and common/source_utils.py.
"""

# Note: Search and source formatting functions have been moved to:
# - common/search_tools.py (duckduckgo_search, tavily_search, perplexity_search)
# - common/source_utils.py (deduplicate_and_format_sources, format_sources)
#
# Please import from those modules instead of here.

# Other utility functions that don't fit into specialized common modules can be added here
